    <h1>Ice Cream Sundae Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/sundae.jpeg" alt="Hot Fudge Sundae">

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>There is a reason a hot fudge sundae is such an enduring classic: That combination of warm, rich chocolate fudge mixing with frozen ice cream and melting it slightly is absolutely irresistible. Of course, if you have homemade fudge sauce and homemade ice cream, it gets even better.</p>

    <p>Vanilla ice cream is the standard here, but feel free to use your favorite flavor, or a combination of flavors. And if you like nuts, by all means use them here. The added crunch is marvelous against all the rich creaminess.</p>

    <h3>Ingredient List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup light corn syrup or honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa</li>

    </ul>
