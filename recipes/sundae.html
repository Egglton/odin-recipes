    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>There is a reason a hot fudge sundae is such an enduring classic: That combination of warm, rich chocolate fudge mixing with frozen ice cream and melting it slightly is absolutely irresistible. Of course, if you have homemade fudge sauce and homemade ice cream, it gets even better.</p>

    <p>Vanilla ice cream is the standard here, but feel free to use your favorite flavor, or a combination of flavors. And if you like nuts, by all means use them here. The added crunch is marvelous against all the rich creaminess.</p>

    <h3>Ingredient List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup light corn syrup or honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>7 ounces finely chopped bittersweet chocolate</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 tablespoon brandy or rum</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream, sugar, corn syrup or honey, cocoa, and salt to a simmer, whisking until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate and let cook until the chocolate melts. Stir in butter and vanilla or liquor. Let cool slightly. Contrary to its name, hot fudge is best served warm, not piping hot.</li>
        <li>For assembly, make the whipped cream. Using a whisk or an electric mixer, beat the cream, sugar, and vanilla until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Pour a little fudge sauce into the bottoms of sundae dishes or bowls. Top with ice cream, then more hot fudge, then nuts if using. Cover all with whipped cream and a cherry if you like. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
